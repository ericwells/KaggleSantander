# KaggleSantander
This is my R code for working on the Santander competition in Fall 2016 on Kaggle.com.

Each working file has an explanatory comment at the top of it.

Files should generally be run in this order:
1) first data must be downloaded from Kaggle.
2) datasampling.R
3) explore.R (optional)
4) models.R
5) models.hist.txt - I manually inserted any models I thought were interesting into this history file so I can remember what I was doing...
