# manual_melting.txt
# By running these commands in the shell in this order, I will manually melt the Kaggle Santander train_ver2 dataset

# sort on month and ID

# split into separate files for each month and drop the demographic columns from being repeating

# left outer join 17 times

# The result should be a single file with a single row for each customer. Only customers who are present in month 17 should be on the file. Order of columns is left to right, Month 1 to Month 17.  
# logistic (target=ColX(of M17), predictors = colsX:Y(of M16:M11))]
# predict (predictors = colsX:Y(of M17:M12))
