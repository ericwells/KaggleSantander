# models.hist.txt: This is where I am manually documenting certain insightful models.

Index of solutions
"ksb" stands for kaggle santander bank.  I will name all of my models as ksb_XXX.
ksb_random: Use a random number generator to create the score.
ksb_model1: just a junk model to test the ability to successfully submit on Kaggle.  I built the solution using command line tools.  I just used a guess as to what products are common and submitted that as the entry for every record.  Got position 812 on the leaderboard with performance of 0.0089792.
ksb_model2: a "model" (if you can even call it that) that is just the most popular products in Month 16.  Built the solution using command line tools. Got position 743 with performance of 0.0137986.
