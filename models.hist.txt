# models.hist.txt: This is where I am manually documenting certain insightful models.

Index of solutions
"ksb" stands for kaggle santander bank.  I will name all of my models as ksb_XXX.
ksb_random: Use a random number generator to create the score.
ksb_model1: just a junk model to test the ability to successfully submit on Kaggle.  I built the solution using command line tools.  I just used a guess as to what products are common and submitted that as the entry for every record.  Got position 812 on the leaderboard with performance of 0.0089792.
ksb_model2: a "model" (if you can even call it that) that is just the most popular products in Month 16.  Built the solution using command line tools. Got position 743 with performance of 0.0137986.
ksb_model3: same as ksb_model2 except deduping products that a customer already has in month 17.  See command_line_tools.txt and ksb_model3.R and postprocess_mysolutioncsv.awk.  Oddly, the performance was only 0.0019652.  That is a head-scratcher because it should be exactly the same as ksb_model2 except dropping folks existing products.  Tomorrow I need to hand audit a few records and also confirm my understanding of the "added products" concept.
